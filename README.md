Steps to follow:
Step 1
Go to the FacialRecognition folder and open its files in a code editor( I used Visual Studio Code )

Step 2
Change the interpreter. Hit Ctrl + Shift + P in VS Code. Choose select interpreter:python >> Enter interpreter path. Open the Scripts folder (HospitalFaceRecognition >> facerecog >> myvenvpy >> Scripts >> python

Step 3
Run FacialRecognition >> app.py using the selected interpreter.
Type 'streamlit run app.py' on the terminal. This will open the streamlit app in the browser.

Notes:
After every registration, go back to the code editor and delete the '.jpg' file in images and refresh the app on the browser to proceed smoothly.
After every payment success, run the demo.py file. This will give the order id as output. Copy it, and paste it as order id in the payment.html file.
